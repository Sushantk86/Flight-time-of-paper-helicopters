Design and Analysis of Industrial Experiments 
Objective : To enhance the design of a paper  helicopter with the goal of maximizing its flight duration through meticulous experimental design and analysis, based on factorial design principles 
Method : Orthogonal Components System and the Linear-Quadratic System for data analysis
Procedure : 3 level factorial design and five factors - wing length (l), wing width (w), body length (L), body width (W), and middle body length (d)
This approach structured our design as a 3^(5-2) fractional factorial design, resulting in a total of 27 distinct helicopter designs. Each of these 27 configurations was tested 3 times, yielding a robust data set with three replications per run.
